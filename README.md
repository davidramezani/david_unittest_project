# Testing on Android
<b>What Is Testing?</b><br/>
With test cases, we can verify over and over again with a single click that our written code is working. That's extremely useful and becomes even more important when you're working on big projects.<br/>
This is personal learning project, the main project is <a href="https://pl-coding.com/courses/testing-on-android/">Testing on Android from Phlipp Lancker</a> that I think very useful to start testing on android.
